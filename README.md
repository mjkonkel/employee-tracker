# Employee Tracker

## Description
This repo contains code for challenge 12 of the bootcamp. For this challenge we needed to create a CLI app to track employees in a database. This week we learned the fundamentals SQL and the motivation for this challenge was to get practice interacting with a database using mysql2. Using the command line, the user can interact with the database through various prompts.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run `npm i` in the command line.

## Usage
>Start the app by running `node index.js` in the command line.<br>
>This will start inquirer and show the different actions that can be done using the app.<br>
